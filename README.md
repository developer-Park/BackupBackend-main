This project was developed in collaboration with several other members during my time at SAIT College. Working for a client based in Calgary, we developed a SaaS application that facilitates exchanging digital assets while also providing support and administrative functionalities to keep the application running.

What are the business objectives of this application:
* Digital asset security is a new and emerging market, and competing against the market is feasible as a small team (e.g LastPass).
* Build a SaaS solution that allows for members to create projects, invite members, and exchange assets in a secure way.
* Provide support to customers and members of the application from an administrative portal.

As the lead developer and project manager, I was personally tasked with coordinating efforts from all team-members and writing out a huge portion of the code-base. It was a very fun project to build!
